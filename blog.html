                    <header>Robots.txt
                    </header>
                    <div class="robotsblog">
                        <p>As the web developed, not only human people were using it , also robots. Then an idea was raised ,
                            this is the result.
                            <BR>A .txt called <i>robots.txt</i> is a document which tells how robots shouls behave when entering the
                            website , for example , what should they look at and also what they are not allowded to do.

                        </p>

                        <p>This document is not restricting the robots behavior because it's just informing them of how the
                            author wants them to behave . For example if you are planning to bann robots on certain parts
                            of your website be aware that they will struggle to access that area in particular .<br> The
                            file robots.txt is suposed to be in the same directory as the main page so it is accesible. 
                        </p>

                    <div class="humansblog">
                        <p>I told you before that the robots.txt was written to tell robots how to behave in a webpage , but
                            another idea was held, also a new idea called <i>humans.txt</i> was raised .<br> This .txt is suposed
                            to be used just by humans , and it is made to identify the author of the webpage and the people
                            that had work on it, basically it's a list of people but it has three sections in some webpages.

                        </p>
                        <p>As well as the people working on the web and the main creator there is also a third part called "
                            site " in which the date of the last update of the web is included , and so it is the software
                            that was used to develop it. I do think that this is also a good idea because there is a way
                            of recognize people's work by putting them into this file.

                    <div class="Open Graph">
                        <p>Nowadays social media is a way of comunication and also a way of promoting things, in order to make
                            it posible for normal people to promote their websites , Open Graph was created.
                            <br>So basicaly with Open Graph you will see what is the website about and also a photo which does not need to be in the website.
                            It's all about to add metatags in your header in the main website and that's all . The most normal tags to use are image , url , title , description and type .
                          
                 
                        </p>
                        <p>Do not hesitate of discover more about this , even facebook has a proper forum with much more useful information about this.
                            It's a good way of spreading your website tho .

                    <header>Separating html and css
                    </header>
                    <div class="htmlcss">
                        <p>There are two diferent documents when it comes to web development , the first one is HTML which is
                            just the structure of the webpage and basically all the information that it has.
                            <br> The other one is CSS and this takes part in making the HTML document look appealing and
                            fresh. The main aim of using css is to add some designs and make your website look good so more
                            people would like to visit your website. However , a lot of things that are done with css could
                            also be done in the HTML document , but why should be separate this ?
                        </p>
                        <p>Well if we have the main information and the structure of the website in one html document we can
                            change the looking just by changing the css and also we can link more than one css documents
                            in each html so we can have as much styles as we want.
                            <BR> Also using css designs and html makes it easier for everyone to understand how a website works.
                            Almost everybody can understand this type of code so it is a good practice to use it .
